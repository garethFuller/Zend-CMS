This is intended to be a simple CMS like perch for the purpose of learning Zend Framework and some current 
client projects.

Core functionality of the system will be to have editable regions identified by the html5 data property on html elements. The template files with the new properties should be able to be copied straight into the themes directory in the cms and just ... work!

<p data-editable-type="textInput" data-editable-title="Title the client will see"></p>

System should be able to identify the following in this instance :

- Tag is editable
- Tag is of type textInput
- Editable title for client is "Title the client will see"

Another thought is to have the editbale regions as view helpers, so rather than create a whole module library I can just create new view helpers for different types of ediatble content for example "_gallery.phtml". This should enable flexability without changing to much core functionality for different clients ... or at least thats the idea :D

Notes:

This project uses Zend Framework version 1.11.11, add a include path value in vhost definition / include path to use.
