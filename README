This is intended to be a simple CMS like perch for the purpose of learning Zend Framework and some current 
client projects.

Core functionality of the system will be to have editable regions identified by classes on html elements for example

<p class="editable:textInput:Title"></p>

System should be able to identify the following in this instance :

- Tag is editable
- Tag is of type textInput
- Editable title for client is "Title"

Another thought is to have the editbale regions as view helpers, so rather than create a whole module library I 
can just create new view helpers for different types of ediatble content for example "_gallery.phtml". This
should enable flexability without chnaging to much core functionality for different clients ... or at least 
thats the idea :D

Notes:

This project uses Zend Framework version 1.11.11, add a include path value in vhost definition to use.
